README

First import all items in requirements.txt

To test a file you must hardcode the name of the file you want to run where it says data= read_google("FILE NAME HERE")
Programs currently programmed to run file input/test.txt
All files are found in the input folder and begin with "input/"
Data = read_google("FILE") can be found at line 73 in all files
This might make the code ugly but it was done for readability/useability

Randomize sometimes has an index error in the random_grid function.
This seems to only occur upon first loading the program IF it occurs at all
It should not be an issue because it is the exact same as functioning code in another file
If this is an issue, merely copy and paste the first few lines of code form genetics algorithm, change the variables to suit the randomize.py and run
This is more fully explained in the write up/report
Shouldn't actually happen - doesn't always
It is a mystery - I am sorry.

Output prints in console.
